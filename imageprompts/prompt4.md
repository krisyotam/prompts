**Prompt Instructions:**
Use Midjourney version 5 for better results. Activate it using the /settings command. 

If you want more complex characters, you can copy and paste in the prompt the image URL of the image you would like to reproduce. You can find many beautiful examples at https://notioly.com/

Characters used for example images are: 
1 woman with cat
2 smiling girl
3 angry man, short hair
4 short hair old man with a hamster
5 happy old woman
6 60 year old woman with bear
7 happy nerd boy, short hair
8 Boyscout
9 John Lennon playing guitar

Keep the description of the character as simple and minimal as possible. The more information you add to the prompt, it will reproduce more details and so the image will be less minimalist Notion style.

If you like the prompt, I will appreciate at lot your 5-star rating. Thank you in advance.
